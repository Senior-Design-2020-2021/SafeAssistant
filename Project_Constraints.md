# Project Constraints

## Introduction

There are a number of Constraints that could impact the progress of the SafeAssistant Project, and therefore should be considered in the planning phase. These constraints include the Time and  Economic Costs of the project, as well as the enforcing of Security in the final product. This combined with various social factors will influence the rate of adoption from the intended users of SafeAssistant. Consideration of these constraints will have an important impact on the overall success of the project

## Economic Cost

For this project, we would like the cost of our product to be comparable to other voice assistants. This means we may be limited in terms of how much money we can spend on this project. The theoretical price for our product could be slightly higher because we are selling security as a main feature, but it shouldnâ€™t discourage too many potential buyers. 

## Security

Since user privacy is a key selling point of our project, a significant amount of time will need to be invested into security development. We plan to limit our product to using a closed network to transmit voice recordings. 

## Time

The majority of the development of this project will take place during the Spring Semester. This only gives us a few months to fully implement our vision for the project. 

## Legal and Ethical

We could face constraints in the design of Safe Assistant if there are patents for other voice assistant systems currently registered. If a patent holder analyzes Safe Assistant and recognizes that it infringes upon their patent for a voice assistant, we could face legal consequences and have to stop openly providing our product. Our team needs to conduct more research into the legal constraints set by registered voice assistant patents.

## Social

Our project also entails a few social concerns. Because our software package that we create will be open-source and freely available to use, it serves as a benefit for society by providing anyone with the ability to use a voice assistant and freely modify it for their personal uses. Additionally, it enhances the lives of users by providing them with a privacy-focused alternative to the other options available on the market. With all of the privacy and security concerns of current voice assistants that people use, providing users full transparency and control of their data will enhance their lives and be a benefit to society.
