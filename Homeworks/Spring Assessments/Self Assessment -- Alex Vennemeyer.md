# Individual Capstone Assessment -- Alex Vennemeyer

## Contribution

During the course of this Project, I contributed strongly to the overall design, and documentation of the application architecture and aided in the subject matter research of voice assistant technology that was required to determine the application design.

I Implemented the base server and client modules that detailed the server client communication protocol, the device startup sequence, and the method of configuring the device settings. I also wrote the module loader that would allow applications to be easily installed by simply putting the application files in the applications folder of the device filesystem. In this part of the development process, my experience with python and with networking was very helpful, as the primary portion of the code I wrote deals with communication over a network.

## Team Achievements

 As a team, our group was able to create a functioning voice assistant system. This was unlike any kind of software that our group members had created before, and it also leveraged hardware and third party libraries that were new to the group.

As a team, I felt that we were able to work together very successfully. One of the greatest successes was the groupâ€™s practice of meeting every monday and wednesday to go over the status of trh project, work on class assignments, and generally ensure that the project was on schedule. This really allowed us to make steady progress, and to ensure that each group member had everything they needed to succeed. The other practice that was helpful was the division of parts of our application among group members. We organized our code into a series of modules, with each piece of functionality being assigned to a group member. This allowed all of our group to contribute efficiently, and enabled us to maximize our progress. Overall, I felt that each  member of our group made a great effort, and contributed well to the project as a whole. Due to this, we were able to produce a working prototype of our voice assistant system by the end of the project time frame.
