## Abstract

The goal of Safe Assistant is to produce a secure, simple, and highly configurable Voice Assistant solution that puts as much control as possible in the hands of the user. Safe Assistant will be designed to operate and process speech on a closed network, protecting consumer privacy. Other voice assistant companies want user data, a conflict of interest with the customers. Safe Assistant’s software will be open source, allowing for users to fully customize their experience. Safe Assistant will be able to run on pre-determined and packaged hardware for customers that don’t want to research and purchase separate hardware.
