# Project Description

## Problem Statement

Voice Assistant Systems can be highly useful, but due  to the nature of the technology, they are always on, collecting data about everything the user does. This means that if the user wants privacy, it is highly important that the system is trustworthy. Unfortunately the companies that produce the most popular solutions make a lot of money on personal data. There is no incentive for trustworthy behavior, and no mechanism to verify trustworthiness.

## Project Background

The goal of Safe Assistant is to produce a secure, simple, and highly configurable Voice Assistant solution that puts as much control as possible in the hands of the user. Safe Assistant will be designed to operate and process speech on a closed network, protecting consumer privacy. Other voice assistant companies want user data, a conflict of interest with the customers. Safe Assistant’s software will be open source, allowing for users to fully customize their experience. Safe Assistant will be able to run on pre-determined and packaged hardware for customers that don’t want to research and purchase separate hardware.
